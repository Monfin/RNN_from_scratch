# RNN_from_scratch
Recurrent Neural Network "from scratch" on PyTorch

## Custom RNN (first level)
### Linear layer with weights initialization as torch.Tensor
### RNN cell to concatenate states and inputs via tanh or relu
### RNN layer with recurrent block (memory_cell) + simple attention preprocessing
### Output block

## Compared the results with the library implementation
