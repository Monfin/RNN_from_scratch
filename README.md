# RNN_from_scratch
Recurrent Neural Network "from scratch" on PyTorch

## Custom RNN (first level)
### Linear layer with weights initialization as torch.Tensor
### RNN cell to concatenate states and inputs via tanh or relu
### RNN layer with recurrent block (memory_cell from rnn_cell) and output block ~ 46% accuracy
### + simple attention_1d ~ +10% accuracy

## Compared the results with the library implementation
### + simple attention_1d ~ +10% accuracy
